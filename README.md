	nltk.
	Concepts of stop-words.
	Bags of word model.

1. Natural Language Processing (NLP):
 It is the technique of teaching a Machine or a Computer to understand what is said in written or in spoken. it can be used on texts and different languages using different Machine Learning Classification  Algorithms.
 
2. Sentiment Analysis: 
	Here we train a machine to understand some text provided to it, and do processing on it and predict certain outcomes as a recommendation to the text we provided for the analysis as outcome.
3. re library:
	Use to simplify the text of  the dataset, and allows us for the process of steaming.
4. Process of Steaming:
	Takes only the root word of the texts or statements or sentences, and removes all the irrelevant sentences in the dataset which may cause poor performance of our model.  eg. ‘I loved this restaurant’. in this sentence the steaming process will only grab the word love, it will remove its tense.
5. nltk (Natural Language Tool Kit):
	This tool kit library allows us to download the ensembles of the stop-words 
6. Concepts of stop-words:
	Stop-words contains all the words which we don’t want to include in our dataset after the cleaning of the dataset. the words consists – e.g. a, an, this, -, / , or, end etc. which does not allows our model to predict whether the statement is positive or negative.
7. Bags of word model:
	It is the model or algorithm under the Natural Language Processing. It represents text as bag of words using python list disregarding of the grammar and order of the text to retrieve the information.
